According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the new Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to provide emergency funding for small businesses that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis, is working well. At a White House briefing on Tuesday, he said that the banks participating in the program, which is overseen by the Small Business Administration, have already distributed loans to more than a million companies that have ten or fewer employees. A summary report from the Treasury Department showed that the average size of the P.P.P. loans, which recipient businesses don’t have to repay if they use the money to keep workers on their payroll, has been two hundred and six thousand dollars. “We’re pleased with the success of this program and how quickly this got up operationally,” Mnuchin said.

By the end of last week, the P.P.P. had already exhausted the three hundred and forty billion dollars that Congress set aside for it in the $2.2 trillion cares Act, which Donald Trump signed at the end of March. On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that allots another three hundred and ten billion dollars to the small-business program. But the P.P.P. is also embroiled in controversy. In recent days, a number of small firms have filed lawsuits against banks, claiming lenders have favored their bigger customers and excluded many of the businesses that the program was intended to help. It has also emerged that a number of large companies, including the Shake Shack and Potbelly restaurant chains, exploited a carve-out to obtain loans through the P.P.P. After widespread complaints, Shake Shack announced that it would repay the ten million dollars it received. At Tuesday’s briefing, Mnuchin said he would be asking other companies to follow suit, and he insisted, “We want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that need it.”
